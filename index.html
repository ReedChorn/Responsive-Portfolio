      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/myface.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">
      <p>
        I was (born July 21, 1993), and live in Santa Ana. I am Cambodian and Chinese.
        I grew up going to schools outside my community due to better education 
        opportunities and was often taken care of by grandparents putting me in many different
        and interesting environments. From this, I was fortunate enough to make friends of many
        kinds, and always look forward to making more. (even if I am a bit introverted) I also
        have a large family and support group. 
    </p>

        I studied Biology in college and went to UCR. I first applied in engineering for a
        year, until I was having trouble and lost passion in the major. After the switch to
        biology, I felt much more comfortable and natural. Studying programming/computers briefly
        occured, scattered through my life from editing HTML on Tumblr to polish my blog page to
        some light work involving engineering and personal dabblings. I now hope to find a fresh start
        at UCI and maybe even incorperating other skills such as my science background. 
    </p>

        I tend to jump around and alternate from a number of different hobbies. 
        I like cooking, Netflix, and hiking. I am a big fan of eating + cooking shows, which
        made a natural transition towards me cooking and finding the fun in making/perfecting new meals.
        Being active is a big part of my life as I often go on walks and go to the gym. I also used to be
        in basketball and martial arts leagues emphasizing early activity as a foundation for my activity today.
        I've studied/am studying science and computers. I like reading online forums, T.V. show lore, and 
        articles on technological breakthroughs, physics and biology. 
        I like video games, yet mostly nintendo games as it is a big part of my childhood. 
        Sleep is also fun. I have a dog named Quino. I like collecting socks and fridge magnets.
